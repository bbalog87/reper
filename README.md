## What is reper?
reper is a pipeline to detect repetitive sequences in genome sequencing data.
The detection is based on kmer frequencies and does not rely on a genome assembly.
This allows an analysis of repeat sequences of organisms with large and repeat rich
genomes (especially plants). For a detailed explanation of the pipeline, see the [reper wiki](https://github.com/nterhoeven/reper/wiki/How-does-reper-work%3F).


## How do I get reper?
reper is available as Docker container, Singularity image or can be installed manually.
Please visit the [reper wiki installation page](https://github.com/nterhoeven/reper/wiki/Installation) for detailed explanations.

## How do I run reper?
Running reper is very easy. You just need to adjust the config file and start reper with `reper kmerCount`.
A detailed explanation of the available commands is given in the [usage page of the reper wiki](https://github.com/nterhoeven/reper/wiki/Using-reper).
Or you can take a look at the [Tutorial](https://github.com/nterhoeven/reper/wiki/Tutorial) and learn how to analyze the
repeat content of the sugar beet using reper.
